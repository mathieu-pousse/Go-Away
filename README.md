## Installing Golang on Linux | Mac | BSD

Get the [Tarball](https://golang.org/doc/install?download=go1.6.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz), and extract it into /usr/local, creating a Go tree in /usr/local/go.

```
$ tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.6.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Run this command as the superuser. Add `/usr/local/go/bin` to the PATH environment variable. You can do this by adding this line to your /etc/profile (for a system-wide installation) or $HOME/.profile

```
$ export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
```

Create a workspace on your localhost, then export the $GOPATH to point to that location.

```
$ mkdir $HOME/gowork
$ export GOPATH=$HOME/gowork

```


## Hello Go!

In a file `hello.go` write the hello world program.

```
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, world")
}
```

Then compile it with the go tool:

```
$ go run /path/to/file/hello.go

hello, world

```
If you see the "hello, world" message then your Go installation is working.

##Documentation

Running the documentation on the localhost is simple

```
$ godoc -http=:6060

```
Then, you can read the documention from the browser [link](http://localhost:6060)
